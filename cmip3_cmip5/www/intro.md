#### Data Selection

*   Select at least one climate variable, scenario, corresponding model, month, decade, and area (region or city) to plot.
*   Time Series, variability plots, and heat map
    *   If multiple climate variables are selected, the data subset is truncated to the first in the list.
    *   The time series and variability plots are univariate.
    *   The heat map is bivariate but X and Y are categorical variables.
    *   The data, Z, is still a single variable and may consist of temperature or precipitation values but not both.
*   Scatter Plot
    *   Must select two climate variables.
    *   If only one climate variable is selected, you may not plot. The scatter plot is bivariate.
*   If months or decades left blank, selection defaults to all. Select only what you want, but no need to click every factor level.
*   Years are the intersection of the years slider and the decades list. One may suffice, unless you want partial or discontinuous decades.
*   You may subset data when minimally required selections are complete. This text will vanish and a blue subset button will appear.
*   You may download data when subset is complete. The data selection panel will minimize and the plot options panel will appear below.

#### Plot Options

*   Plot options are based on the data in use and must be selected after subsetting the data.
*   Since plot options are based on the data subset, any changes to data selections will require generating a new data set and selecting plot options again.
*   As with the data download, you may plot in the browser or download the plot as a PDF via the respective buttons when subsetting is complete.
