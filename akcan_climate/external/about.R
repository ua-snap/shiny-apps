		The data in the app and their varied representations are subject to change and should not be considered valid and vetted until the final version is released and this message has been removed.
		This release includes both historical and projected global climate model (GCM) output for decadal mean temperature and precipitation.
		There are five Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 3 (CMIP3) GCMs and three emissions scenarios for each.'),
		p(style="text-align:justify",'The app currently has many features.
		The upper sidebar panel is for data selection, choosing units of measurement, and performing the subset action on the master dataset.
		Any time data selections are altered, a new subset must be generated by clicking the appropriate button.'),
		p(style="text-align:justify",'The lower sidebar panel is for generating a plot and specifying general plot formatting.
		Most options here will not auto-update the graphic in the main panel, but currently some may.
		Also, some options are mutually exclusive, so selecting one may immediately alter the selection of another, which may auto-update the plot.
		Generally, however, as with data selection, the user must click the corresponding plot button after making changes to formatting selections.
		The formatting options that appear in the main panel below the plot are ones that will always force an auto-update of the plot as soon as they are changed.'),
		p(style="text-align:justify",'The app allows the user to look at many different kinds of subsets of the data in many ways.
		There is as much control over how the output graphic looks as there is in determining which data it graphs.
		There are also buttons at the bottom of the main panel for downloading a csv file of the currently selected data and a pdf of the current plot.'),

		a("Community Charts",href="http://www.snap.uaf.edu/charts.php", target="_blank"),
		'tool. There are somewhat fewer communities, including only those with populations greater than 2,500.
		However, there is more versatility in terms of data sources, selection/subsetting options, user control, plotting,
		and direct access to tabular data and graphic output in file format rather than strictly as browser viewing.
		I cannot vouch for the population data. I am sure that for some locations the population value shown in small table below the plot has low precision and/or accuracy, or is at least out of date,
		but it is not relevant to the app. I only mention it since the numbers are in fact displayed on the screen.'),
		p(style="text-align:justify",strong('Suggestions:'),'For the time being, this developmental version of the app should function very well. Stay tuned for updates.
		There are a variety of features I am considering adding when I have time.
		These will likely spill over onto additional main panel tabs, somewhere between the two currently called "Communities" and "About".'),
