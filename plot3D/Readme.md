This Shiny app displays plots made using the `plot3D`, `rgl`, and `shinyRGL` packages. Four datasets are currently available.
The `volcano` dataset is provided in base **R** and the `hypsometry` data are loaded from the `plot3D` package.
The latter is a larger dataset and will take longer to draw, especially 3D renderings.
The other two datasets include a sinc function (sampling function, or cardinal sine function) and a Lorenz attractor.
The Lorenz attractor dataset is only available for plotting in 3D with RGL. Other plotting options will not appear in the plot type menu when this dataset is selected.
